<p><b>Problem: </b>I need to know how much area my bathtub can hold because I need to hide all of my abysmal grades.</p>

<h3>The Magical Abilities of Reading</h3>
<p>If you are able to read, then you should be able to read how I solved this incredibly difficult problem.</p>
<p>For starters, I know that my bathtub is in an oval shape, but since I'm too lazy to learn more stuff, I'm going to pretend that the bathtub is an irregular octagon. Although it is not an exact calculation, it is balanced from the slope at the bottom of the bathtub.</p>
<img src = "TRANSFORM.png" alt = "MORE POTATO"/>
<p>Now that I have an octagon, I can split the bathtub up into 4 coungruent triangles, 4 smaller but not entirely congruent rectangles, and a single huge rectangle.</p>
<img src = "splitty.png" alt = "THIS IS NO POTATO!"/>
<p>From here, I just solve for the areas for each of the smaller shapes and combine it to get the approximate area for my bathtub.</p>
<img src = "maths.png" alt = "WHY I HAVE TO DO MATH?"/>
<p>And according to this original piece of source, my bathtub has an appoximate value of <b>XYZ</b>.</p>
